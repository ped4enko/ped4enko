## ðŸ‘‹ About the author

My name is Alex Pedchenko, and I have been working as an Engineer since 2014. I am an avid LLM lover and supporter of the open-source AI philosophy. I am always doing that which I cannot do in order that I may learn how to do it, and I believe in sharing knowledge.

I think it's essential always to keep professional and surround yourself with good people, work hard, and be nice to everyone. You have to perform at a consistently higher level than others. That's the mark of a true professional.
