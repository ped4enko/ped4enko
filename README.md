### Hey, nice to see you here. ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Git page!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Meta AI](https://metadeepml.com/) and [GOOGELECOM PROJECT](https://googelecom.net/) and help with [TurnKey Tech Staffing](https://turnkeystaffing.com/career/). 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Software Development.
- I hold a Ph.D. in construction and have spent a decade working in tech startups and Inc 5000 companies. I've had the opportunity to lead several top-tier projects in Ukraine's construction industry. By leveraging organic traffic, I've successfully attracted clients for outsourcing services with budgets exceeding $1 million. I believe that large language models (LLM) are fantastic tools that can significantly boost our productivity, helping us achieve more in less time.
